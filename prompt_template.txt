I need to summarize a conversation. The transcript of the conversation is between the <data> XML like tags.

<data>
{{transcript}}
</data>

The summary must contain two things, a one word sentiment analysis and a summary of the key points of the conversation in the given transcript, focusing on the main topics discussed and any important decisions or takeaways. Briefly mention the speakers involved. The output must be provided in JSON format shown in the following example. 

Example output:
{
    "sentiment": "<sentiment>",
    "summary": <summary>
}

Write the JSON output and nothing more.

Here is the JSON output:
